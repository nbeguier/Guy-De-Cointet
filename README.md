# Guy de Cointet Deciphering Project

This repository is dedicated to cracking the encrypted oeuvres of French artist Guy de Cointet. Known for using letters and numbers to encrypt his works, our objective is to decipher all his oeuvres to finally understand the messages and ideas he intended to convey.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into directories corresponding to individual pieces of art and date. Each directory contains the following files:

- xx.txt: Transcript of the ciphered text found in the artwork
- xx.tips.txt: Tips and clues to help crack the message
- xx.message.txt: The deciphered message in cleartext, if known
